Wisconsin breeder Wallace Havens bred the first puggle in the 1980s.[2] Havens coined the name puggle and was the first to register the crossbreed with the American Canine Hybrid Club, an organization that tracks crossbred dogs.[citation needed] Although Havens was the first to officially breed a puggle, the history of puggles dates back to the 1980s when U.S. breeders experimented with creating new dogs.[3] By 2000, puggles were being sold commercially to pet owners wanting to own a different, distinctive dog.
